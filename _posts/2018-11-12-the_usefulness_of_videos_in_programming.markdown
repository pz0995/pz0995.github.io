I have found vides helpful in learning programming languages because they can show the audience the uses and practicality of individual languages as well as uses and tutorials for how to make the functions perform the way the audience would desire.
Take, for instance, a website designer who is interested in learning HTML5 to update their webpage. Watching a video tutorial on programming languages would assist the designer with designing the webpage to their liking and possibly learning new functions that they would not have known otherwise.
