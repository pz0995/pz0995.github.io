I have always been interested in technology and computers and how different things work. When I was very young, I would learn about technology and software and build my own computers. When I got out of high school, I went to college to learn more. And while many of the topics were interesting, that school was not for me, so I left and began learning more on my own. I am definitely interested in all things tech, and I enjoy the challenges associated with software development.
