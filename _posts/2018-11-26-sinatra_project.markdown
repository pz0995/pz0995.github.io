Unfortunately, the Sinatra project took much longer than it should have. I was mostly done in a few days. While working on the project, my IDE crashed while in sandbox before my commit. The IDE did not seem to have my project anymore. I started again, trying to duplicate what I had created before. Then when I committed my changes with git commit, the Learn IDE crashed again. 

I asked for help on Slack, but got no response. The technical coaches were not available due to the holiday and long weekend. I switched to a different IDE  called Atom to work on the project, and Atom let me do the project without crashing. Atom does not want to connect to my  account, and I'm having a hard time getting the revisions committed to Github. I looked for resources to help, but I haven't found anything yet. I will get someone to help me after finishing the other project.

Anyway, the instructions said that I have to create a custom app to keep track of something important to me, so I just created an app for my hair accessories because I have a lot of them. I followed the instructions and made sure to include all the requirements on the checklist.
