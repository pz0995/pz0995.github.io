Unfortunately, the Sinatra project took much longer than it should have. I was mostly done in a few days. While working on the project, my IDE crashed while in sandbox before my commit. The IDE did not seem to have my project anymore. I started again, trying to duplicate what I had created before. Then when I committed my changes with "git commit", the Learn IDE crashed again.  Because of the repeated crashing, I was also unable to get a good consistent video for the assignment, which is disappointing. 

I asked for help on Slack but got no response. The technical coaches were not available due to the holiday and long weekend. I switched to a different IDE,  called Atom, to work on the project, and Atom let me do the project without crashing. 

Atom does not want to connect to my Github account for some reason, and I'm having a hard time getting the revisions committed to Github. The instructions did say to commit often, but Atom doesn't seem to be connecting to my account or the repo. I looked for resources to help, but I haven't found anything that worked. Others had similar situations, but the things they did to fix the problem didn't work for me. I will get someone to help me after finishing the other project because it has to be done first.  I also want to go back in to add Corneal, if possible. I was unable to remember how to use it while working on the project. In the Sinatra study group, they explained how to use it in the project.

Anyway, the instructions said that I have to create a custom app to keep track of something important to me, so I just created an app for my hair accessories because I have a lot of them. I followed the instructions and made sure to include the requirements on the checklist.
